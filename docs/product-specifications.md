## Licensing Options

Currently we offer five licensing options with various product specifications to meet different needs. 

You can choose a plan that suites you most at [https://license.datamesh.com/](https://license.datamesh.com/ "License"). It offers several online subscription plans with different deployment count and collaboration device count.

If you need enterprise version or a customized solution instead of the online subscription plans, you can contact us by email service@datamesh.com.
